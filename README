This is a "plugin" for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR).

The block plugin is a fork of the orphaned taste plugin 0.0.2d which was
originally coded by LordJaxom aka Sascha Volkenandt.
Please do not install both plugins (taste AND block)!
Apart from that this probably won't work it simply does not make any sense
at all ;).

Description:

This plugin prevents you from being bothered by unwanted broadcasts. Instead
of those the screen will stay black, the sound muted, an info message
appears in the OSD and after a configurable pause the vdr switches to
another channel.

Unwanted shows are identified by their EPG title in a predefined blacklist.
You can add the current title to the block plugin blacklist by choosing
'Block Broadcast' from the main VDR menu or by editing the blacklist in the
setup of the plugin. In the latter case make sure you close the submenus as
well as the setup menu by 'ok' to properly save your changes. This would
also be the right place to remove entries from the blacklist.

Every time the VDR switches to another channel the block plugin checks if
the EPG title of the current show matches with a blacklist entry and if so
the show won't be displayed and after a configurable pause (default 2s) the
VDR switches to another channel automatically. Usually this will be the next
possible lower channel number if you were coming from a higher one or
vice-versa. If this is not possible, the vdr switches to the last channel
displayed. Of course you can zap to another channel yourself as well.

In case you unexpectedly want to watch a blacklisted show you can override
the block rule by pressing 'Ok' while the message is displayed.

For VDR versions <= 1.3.16 you will have to apply the included patch to the
VDR source in order to have multiple channels being blocked in a row.
Otherwise the block plugin will only skip the first channel. The patch
originates from the taste plugin and was written by Sascha Volkenandt.
