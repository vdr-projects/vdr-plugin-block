VDR Plugin 'block' Revision History
-----------------------------------

2010/06/06: Version 0.0.2

Added a new detection method: Channel EPG
This method scans the running program and not only blocks on zapping but
also makes the plugin switch to another channel on a changeover to a
blacklisted show. In some rare cases several stations do not update
the current EPG signal in sync so unfortunately there might be false 
detections. It is possible to change the detection method in the plugins
setup, where 'On Switch' is the old method and 'Channel EPG' the new.

Furthermore it is now possible to change switching directions on a block
event by pressing the (channel) up/down keys on your remote.

Several other minor code changes. 


**************************************************************************
2010/04/20: Version 0.0.1b

Initial release.

Fix: 'Ok' now in fact unlocks a blocked broadcast reliably
     (switch function was moved to destructor of control.c)


**************************************************************************
2010/04/19: Version 0.0.1

First version.

This version is based on a cvs checkout (20100113) of the orphaned
vdr-plugin taste originally coded by LordJaxom aka Sascha Volkenandt.
Unfortunately the taste plugin did not work on vdr machines lacking a full
feature dvb card. So i tried to change some code  to achieve compatibility
with a broader range of configs and finally came up with a new version that
does the job on machines with a ff-card as well as on budget solutions (in
my case the dxr3) and state-of-the-art softdevice configurations. This patch
can be found here:
http://www.vdr-portal.de/board/thread.php?threadid=92550

Tobi then kindly offered me the opportunity to continue the development of
the taste plugin on projects.vdr-developer.org and i asked Sascha how he
feels about that, but he did not answer. So i decided to publish the new 
version as a fork called 'block'. This way Saschas work will remain 
untouched and i am completely free to continue my work on the plugin.


Differences in the block plugin
-------------------------------

** New features:

-Compatibility with non-ff output including budget and state-of-the-art
softdevice configurations added (channel switch analysis changed)
-Implementation of syslog functions (BLOCK_LOGGING in the Makefile set
	to 1 or 0 respectively will switch logging on/off)
	ATTENTION: This will add lots of entries to your syslog!


** Patches:

Patches by tomg and mapovi which were written for the taste plugin were
applied to a  were applied to a clean cvs checkout of the taste plugin
on 2010/01/13 so that they are permanently build in the block plugin now.

Locale patch:
  - fixed clean target of Makefile
  - adapted Makefile to current newplugin template
  - use translations of main vdr
  - exclude old i18n parts by ifdefs
Version compatibility:
  Changes for VDR >= 1.5.0 (applicable to VDR >= 1.4.5)
Makefile fix:
  added -fPIC to compiler options to prevent FTBFS
